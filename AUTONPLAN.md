# Our Auton Plan 

## Two Ball
* The first ball will be preloaded.
* Align the robot so that it starts right in front of the second ball.
* Have the robot move forward and pick up the second ball.
* Ram up against the hub to shoot the 2 balls.
* Shoot the two balls!
### Possible Adjustments to Two Ball Auton
* Move left or right a little after picking up the second ball to avoind running into other robots or the hub legs.
* Where we go after shooting the balls.

## Four Ball
* Complete all the steps in two ball auton.
* Drive to the human player station, pick up the ball in front of it and have the human players feed another ball.
* Then go back to the hub and ram up against it to align.
* Shoot the balls again!
