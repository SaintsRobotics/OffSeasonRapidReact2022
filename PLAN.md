# Our Autonomous Plan

1. Move to the ball's position
2. Collect the ball with intake - Wheels/Pneumatics
3. Use vision and find the shooter
4. Shoot the darn ball into the hole!

## Alternative After

1. Pickup two other balls (on the side of the field)
2. Use vision and shoot those balls in the hole.
