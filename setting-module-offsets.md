# Setting Swerve Module Offsets

Instructions for how to set the offsets of the turning encoders of the swerve modules.

1. Point all the wheels straight forward.
2. Find the absolute angles of the modules. (Open the left hand window and it's under SmartDashboard > Module Angle Absolute)
3. Save the values from shuffleboard into the turning encoder offset constants. Be sure to match up the value with the correct wheel.
